    <p>
        Now you will be paired with a different partner to the ones you previously played with.
        You have 10 tokens, and you must choose how to divide it between you and your partner.
    </p>
    <p>
        Payoffs are distributed according to the function reported in the following graph,
        where you can see on the X axis your payoff and on the Y axis your partner's.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the end of the experiment, the computer will randomly choose whether to implement your choice or your partnerâ€™s
        choice for how to divide the 10 tokens, and you will be paid according to the chosen division.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please, select the point on the circle that will determine the payoffs.
