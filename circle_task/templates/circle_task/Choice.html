        Now you will be paired with a different partner to the ones you previously played with.
        You have 10 euros, and you must choose how to divide it between you and your partner.
    </p>
    <p>
        Payoffs are distributed according to the function reported in the following graph,
        where you can see on the X axis your payoff and on the Y axis your partner's.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please, select the point on the circle that will determine the payoffs.
