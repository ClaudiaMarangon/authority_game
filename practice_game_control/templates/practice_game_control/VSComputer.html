    <p>
    To ensure all participants fully understand the game before the experiment begins, you will play a number of
        practice rounds as both roles against a computer. <b>The computerâ€™s responses have been drawn from the decisions of
        a sample of participants who previously played a very similar game to this one</b>. On the screen, you will also be
        able to see how many points you would have earned from your decisions if this were the real game. You will play
        20 rounds as an <b>Authority</b> and 20 rounds as a <b>Subordinate</b>. You must complete all 40 practice rounds before you
        can proceed with the experiment.
