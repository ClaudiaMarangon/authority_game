    Practice against computer

    <p>
    To ensure all participants fully understand the game before the experiment begins, you will play a number of
        practice rounds as both roles against a computer. Although this is a practice, you still have a chance to win
        <b>real money!</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>The computerâ€™s responses have been drawn from the decisions of
        a sample of participants from a previous session of this experiment</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the screen, you will also be
        able to see how many points you would have earned from your decisions if this were the real game. You will play
        20 rounds as an <b>Authority</b> and 20 rounds as a <b>Subordinate</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
        You should play the practice rounds as well as you can, because after the experiment, <b>we will randomly select
        ONE participant from the room and pay out his/her practice-round earnings in full.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        You must complete all 40 practice rounds before you
        can proceed with the experiment.
