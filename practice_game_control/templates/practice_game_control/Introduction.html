    <p>This experiment consists of a number of stages in which you can earn experimental tokens. At the end of the
        experiment, the tokens will be exchanged for real money at a rate of 40 tokens for one Euro. The experiment is
        expected to last between 60 and 90 minutes.
    </p>

    <p>
        For most of the experiment, you will play a simple game called the Task Game, which is a game for two players: an <b>Authority</b> and a
        <b>Subordinate</b>.As the name suggests, in this game, there is a task to be performed. There is a payment reward
        for both you and your partner if the task is performed, and either or both of you can perform it. Each player
        decides independently whether to perform the task or not. However:
        <ul>
            <li>If <b>neither of you</b> perform the task, there is no reward</li>
            <li>Performing the task requires effort, so whoever performs it will have to pay a cost.</li>
        </ul>
        Specifically:
        <ul>
            <li>If the Authority performs the task alone and the Subordinate does not perform the task, the <b>Authority
                receives 5</b> and the <b>Subordinate receives 10</b> </li>
            <li>If the Authority does not perform the task and the Subordinate performs the task alone, the <b>Authority
                receives 10</b> and the <b>Subordinate receives 7</b> </li>
            <li>If both players perform the task, the <b>Authority receives 5</b> and the <b>Subordinate receives 7</b> </li>
            <li>If both players do not perform the task, the <b>Authority receives 3</b> and the <b>Subordinate receives
                5</b>.</li>
        </ul>
        These payoffs are displayed in the table below, in which the amount to the left in each box is the payoff for
        the Authority and the payoff to the right is for the Subordinate.

    <table class='table table-bordered text-center'
           style='width: auto; margin: auto'>
        <tr>
            <th colspan=2 rowspan=2></th>
            <th colspan=2>The Subordinate</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Perform</th>
            <th>Do not <br /> perform</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th rowspan=2 style="vertical-align: middle">The Authority</th>
            <th>Perform</th>
            <td>5, 7</td>
            <td>5, 10</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Do not <br /> perform</th>
            <td>10, 7</td>
            <td>3, 5</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        Each player will choose independently whether they want to perform the task or not, and then the computer will
        match the answers and calculate the appropriate payoffs. You will play the Task Game a number of times, in different
        roles, and against different partners. Your payoffs for each round will be added up and will contribute to your
        final earnings at the end of the experiment.
